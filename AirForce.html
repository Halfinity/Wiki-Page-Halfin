            <h3>Who we are - What we do</h3>
            <p>The Israeli Air Force, “Kheil HaAvir” in Hebrew (meaning "Air Corps"), is universally recognized to be among the world’s most powerful aerial fighting forces.
              <br>
              <br> Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the Air Force has played a major role in securing the country’s numerous military victories. Today, the IAF remains a central pillar of the Israel Defense Forces, deterring terrorist threats and ensuring Israel’s strategic advantage in wartime.

                <h3>669 Unit</h3>
                <p>Unit 669 was founded in 1974, in the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when an ad hoc medevac unit made some 5000 extractions. Its initial mandate was to extract and provide initial medical treatment to downed (and possibly injured) pilots beyond lines. However, in later years the unit also participated in extraction of soldiers of other arms of the Israeli Defense Forces, especially Sayeret (Special Forces) fighters in operations beyond enemy lines and seamen in distress.</p>

                <h3>Shaldag Unit</h3>
                <p>Shaldag was founded in 1974, in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, by Muki Betser, a Sayeret Matkal veteran who brought several Matkal veterans with him. Initially operating as a Sayeret Matkal reserve company, it was eventually transferred to the IAF.</p>

                <h3>Air Defense Command</h3>
                <p>During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Air Defense Network was part of the Artillery Corps, primarily relying on machine guns. During the 1960s, 40 mm radar-guided anti-aircraft guns were introduced, and in 1965, MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missiles. The latter were operated by the Air Force's surface-to-air units. In the 1970s, the entire Air Defense Network was merged with the Air Force. </p>
